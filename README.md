This project was done primarily with the idea that we would look at racial disparities in police forces. \
We were admittedly very ambitious at first, wanting to use much more the data provided by the Stanford Open Policing Project (SOPP). 
Unfortunately, due to constraints within Github and the libraries we were using, we had to significantly reduce the amount of data 
we were utilizing. To account for this, we went much narrower than many other exploratory artifacts presented by the SOPP, focusing on California, and then Oakland specifically.

Our work was primarily divided as such: \
Ashwin: Worked primarily on Visualization 2 and 3, and worked on writing \
Daniel: Worked on tooltips for Visualization 1, and worked on a lot of exploratory analysis and writing \
Serena: Created Visualization 1, and did data processing for it, as well as working on formatting 

External processing of the original data files provided by the Stanford Open Policing Project was done using R and the Pandas library in Python.
